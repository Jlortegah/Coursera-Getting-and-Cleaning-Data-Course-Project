## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Jes√∫s Ortega

This repository hosts the R script implemented according to the project instructions and Code book, describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set for the course project of the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### The project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Executing the script `run_analysis.R` and its results
 
1._Download the source data for this project, unzip it and not alter their names

2._Set the path of the working directory to select the location of the source files

3._Execute the R script 

4._The output is a file called `independent_tidy_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.

 
### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
